  <h1>The story in the book</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>
    Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of<i> Nature, New Scientist,</i> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well <br>thumbed copy of <i>On The Road.</i> It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.<br><br>

She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her <br>pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="deoxyriboneuclic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <i>did</i> think she had something better to do.
